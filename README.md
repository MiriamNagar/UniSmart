# UniSmart

## About The Project
UniSmart is a mobile application built to help organize and simplify academic life. The main goal of the project is to provide a smart schedule planner that automatically generates optimized class schedules based on user preferences and constraints. 

## Target Audience
The application is designed for two main types of users:
* Students: Can build their schedules, save important course notes and receive university alerts.
* Administrators: Can access an analytics dashboard to view total enrollment data, track high-demand courses, and identify scheduling bottlenecks.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into a few main areas to keep the code clean. The `app` folder contains all the visible screens and the navigation flow of the application. The `components` folder holds reusable visual elements like buttons and menus, while the `contexts` folder acts as the application's memory to store user data and saved plans.

## Get Started
This project is built using Expo and React Native. To run the project locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```


Hope the app will ease your scheduling process!
